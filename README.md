# Queuing Models Simulation using Arena

## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

United Dairy Farmers is a chain of stores offering dairy products and retail items. During peak hours, customers usually find long queues at the billing counter and milkshake counter at UDF stores, causing them inconvenience. Many of the customers prefer to buy their dairy products from other stores nearby to avoid long queues at UDF, resulting in loss of revenue for the UDF store. This project aims to minimize tgis loss of revenue and optimize customer service operations at UDF.
